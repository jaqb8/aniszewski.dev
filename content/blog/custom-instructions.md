Chat GPT, the renowned language model, has recently introduced a feature that's been eagerly awaited by enthusiasts: Custom Instructions.

This feature has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the model, offering a more tailored and precise output. According to OpenAI's official website:

> ChatGPT will consider your custom instructions for every conversation going forward. The model will consider the instructions every time it responds, so you wonâ€™t have to repeat your preferences or information in every conversation.

In this article, we'll delve into the significance of these custom instructions and how to harness their full potential.

### The Magic of Custom Instructions

At its core, the custom instructions feature in Chat GPT is a user-friendly way to add context to your prompts. By providing the model with specific instructions, users can guide the AI to produce results that align more closely with their intentions. Think of it as giving the model a clearer roadmap to follow.

### How Do Custom Instructions Work?

The feature introduces two fields for users to fill out:

1. **Personal Context**:

   This field is designed for any information that pertains to the user.

2. **Output Modification**:

   This section is where users can guide how Chat GPT should respond.
   To visualize how this works, imagine GPT's knowledge as a vast circle. A generic prompt might allow the model to pull information from anywhere within that circle. However, with custom instructions, you're essentially narrowing down the area from which the model can draw its response. The more specific your instructions, the smaller and more focused the circle becomes.

### The Art of Crafting Effective Instructions

Crafting the right instructions is akin to speaking to a specialist. If you have an accounting issue, you'd consult an accountant. Similarly, for Chat GPT to provide the best answers, you need to "speak" to the right persona within the model. This is where the concept of 'persona modeling' comes into play. By laying out details in a specific manner, you can guide the model to respond as if it were a particular "persona".

For instance, if you're looking for marketing advice, you can set up a "digital marketer persona" with specific interests, values, and principles. This ensures that the responses you get align with the expertise and tone of a digital marketer.

#### Here are some examples of custom instructions:

## Digital Marketing Specialist

    **Personal Context**:
    _"I am a digital marketing specialist with 5 years of experience in SEO, content marketing, and social media campaigns. I've worked with both B2B and B2C clients, helping them improve their online presence and drive organic traffic."_

    **Output Modification**: _"Provide answers with a focus on digital marketing strategies, using industry-specific jargon. Ensure responses are data-driven and reference best practices in the field."_

## Nutritionist Specializing in Vegan Diets

    **Personal Context**:
    _"I am a certified nutritionist with a focus on plant-based and vegan diets. I help clients transition to veganism while ensuring they receive all essential nutrients."_

    **Output Modification**:
    _"Provide answers that emphasize the benefits and challenges of vegan diets. Ensure responses are backed by nutritional science and offer practical dietary advice."_

Leveraging the Digital Marketing Specialist persona offers tailored insights into the dynamic world of online marketing, ensuring responses are data-driven and in line with industry best practices. Simultaneously, the Nutritionist Specializing in Vegan Diets persona provides expert guidance on plant-based nutrition, presenting scientifically-backed and practical advice. Together, these personas ensure users receive precise, actionable, and relevant information tailored to their specific fields of interest.

### The Impact of Custom Instructions

To understand the real impact of these instructions, consider the difference in responses with and without them. A generic prompt might yield a broad, less-focused answer. However, with custom instructions, the response becomes more refined, detailed, and relevant to the context provided.

For instance, when asked to evaluate the viability of an online language tutoring platform, the model's response without custom instructions might be more general. But with a "serial entrepreneur" persona, the answer becomes more strategic, touching on specific market dynamics, competition, and financial considerations.

### Crafting Your Own Custom Instructions

While it might seem daunting to craft these instructions, there are resources available. Templates, such as the one detailed in [this "The AI Advantage" YouTube video](https://youtu.be/o4N1v0DnZdE?si=lrMnDX26Gaw-9nv8), provide a framework that outlines professional roles, specialized knowledge, and other specifics. Users can mix and match different parts of these templates to fit their needs. The key is to be as specific as possible without causing confusion.

### Conclusion

Chat GPT's custom instructions are a game-changer. They offer users the ability to get more precise, relevant, and context-aware responses from the model. By taking the time to craft effective instructions, users can transform their Chat GPT experience, making the model an even more powerful tool in their arsenal. As with any tool, the more you understand and fine-tune it, the better the results you'll achieve. So, dive in, experiment with these custom instructions, and unlock the true potential of Chat GPT.
