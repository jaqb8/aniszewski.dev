Streamers Spotlight is a web application designed to bridge the gap between streamers and their target audience. Developed as a comprehensive platform, it serves as a digital hub where streamers can showcase their unique content, and viewers can discover and engage with them. The application is engineered using a robust stack of technologies, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and a seamless user experience.

## Key Features

- **Streamer Profiles:**
  This core feature allows users to browse through a curated list of streamers, complete with bios, streaming platforms, and content descriptions. This is instrumental in driving user engagement and reducing bounce rates.

- **Like and Dislike Functionality:**
  A built-in preference system enables users to like or dislike streamer profiles, thereby providing valuable user-generated data that can be leveraged for future content recommendations and personalization algorithms.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:**
  The server-side logic is built on **NestJS**, a progressive **Node.js** framework known for its efficiency and scalability. Data storage is handled by **MongoDB**, a NoSQL database that offers flexibility and high performance. **TypeORM** serves as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, streamlining the data manipulation processes.

- **Frontend:**
  The user interface is crafted using **React**, a leading JavaScript library that excels in building dynamic and interactive UIs.
